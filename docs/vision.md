# Vision

Our vision is to facilitate the use of "open" language models in academic
research. In a sentence, the guiding principle is:

> It should be as easy for researchers to use an open-source LLM as a
> closed/proprietary LLM.

We propose to do this by creating a _simple_, _code-free_, _graphical interface_
for the following:

- **Deploying** open LMs on university HPC infrastructure
- **Interacting** with open LMs via familiar graphical interfaces (chat,
  completion, etc.)

We believe that there are considerable benefits to creating this product:

- **Enabling** a broad range of researchers to engage with LM technology.
- **Facilitating** open, reproducible research with LMs.
- Creating a means for **optimizing** shared resource usage.
